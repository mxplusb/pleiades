# Contributing!

* Open an issue with a proposed change if it's larger than a bugfix
* Mage is the build tool
* Everything should be compilable or runnable with `go <action>`
* Be very careful about memory allocations
* Make sure to `go fmt` any changes you make
* I use linear commits whenever possible
* Fix-forward, no backports
* Document your code
* Ask questions if you get stuck!
