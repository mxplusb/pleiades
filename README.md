# Pleiades

Pleiades is a globally distributed, [constellation mesh database](#what-is-a-constellation-mesh) designed to enable complex and systemically critical workloads.

## Current State

Pleiades has been under active development since May 2022, and has undergone many design iterations and test implementations. These iterations are critical to finding and designing the right internal architectural patterns and implementations to meet systemically critical workload requirements.

Pleiades is currently going through it's 3rd and final major internal architecture overhaul, which includes a complete rewrite. For more information, see [#63](https://github.com/mxplusb/pleiades/issues/63). It is still in pre-alpha state.
